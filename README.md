# Travel Chat

Travel Chat is a social media app built for active travellers or nomads who are looking to meet like-minded people in the same city theyâ€™re currently in or will be travelling to. The platform allows for users to connect with friends over a built-in chat box. Travel Chat also allows users to search up other users based on the location they'll be, when they will be there, and keywords from their profile write-up.
